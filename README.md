# Numerical Matlab Assignment
  Matlab code for an assignment i got to find the root of 5 equations using the following types of methods:
1) Newton's Method
2) Modified Newton's Method
3) Secant Method

I just edit one above mentioed Newton's Method with a bit of tweaks to run the other 2 methods of convergence.
